### `SuperHash`

Creates a new SuperHash
### `set(keys, value)`
* **keys** (`...*`) Used to generate hash
* **value** (`*`) to be associated with the key

Creates a hash from the keys if it doesn't exist and sets the last argument passed in as the value
### `get(keys)`
* **keys** (`...*`) Used to generate a hash for lookup

Returns the value associated with the hash generated from the keys
### `has(keys)`
* **keys** (`...*`) - Used to generate a hash for lookup

Tells whether or not value associated with the hash generated from the keys is in the map
### `forEach(cb, context)`
* **cb** (`Function`) callback to invoke with all params
* **context** (`*`) for the callback 

Loops through each value in the hashmap passing it as the first argument in callack

```js
hashMap.forEach(function(value){
  
});
```
### `delete(keys)`
* **keys** (`...*`) - Used to generate a hash for lookup

Removes the hash generated by the keys and the associated value
