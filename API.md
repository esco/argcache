### `SuperHash(entries)`
* **entries** (`Array`) two dimensional array with entries to prefill the map. Keys must be an array (even if just one)

Creates a new SuperHash

 Example `entries` Array

```
[[1,2,3],'foo'], [[{foo: 'bar', {blip:'blop'}],'bar']]
```
### `set(keys, value)`
* **keys** (`...*`) Used to generate hash
* **value** (`*`) to be associated with the key

Creates a hash from the keys if it doesn't exist and sets the last argument passed in as the value
### `get(keys)`
* **keys** (`...*`) Used to generate a hash for lookup

Returns the value associated with the hash generated from the keys
### `has(keys)`
* **keys** (`...*`) - Used to generate a hash for lookup

Tells whether or not value associated with the hash generated from the keys is in the map
### `forEach(cb, context)`
* **cb** (`Function`) callback function called with `(key, value)` for each entry in the map
* **context** (`*`) `this` context for the callback 

Loops through each value in the hashmap passing it as the first argument in callack

```js
hashMap.forEach(function(value){
  
});
```
### `delete(keys)`
* **keys** (`...*`) - Used to generate a hash for lookup

Removes the hash generated by the keys and the associated value
